            <p>For nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade protected the right to a safe, legal abortion in the United States at
                the federal level. However, in 2022, with the Supreme Court ruling in <strong>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s
                    Health Organization</strong>, abortion is no longer considered protected under the U.S. Constitution
                and is left up to the states to decide.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Abortion Bans Across the Country</h2>
            <p>Twenty-one states now ban or restrict abortions earlier in pregnancy than the standard set by Roe v.
                Wade, which governed reproductive rights for nearly a century before.</p>

            <p><br>Abortion is legal in the rest of the country, and several states have even added new protections since
                Dobbs.</p>

            <p><br>Obstetricians are leaving the states that have put bans in place as they cannot provide the necessary
                care to their patients, even women facing life-threatening pregnancy complications. Maternal and infant
                deaths have increased since pregnant people have been forced to carry pregnancies to term with no chance
                of survival, at risk to their own health and survival.<br></p>

            <p><br>Additionally, abortion bans disproportionately affect poor women and women of color, further contributing
                to systemic inequalities by unequal limitation of their access to essential healthcare.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Threats to Reproductive Freedoms from an Anti-Rights Administration</h2>
            <p>Following the election of Donald Trump, the threats to reproductive freedom have only grown larger. Trump
                has spoken openly about his views on abortion and his goals to ban or limit abortion access. During his
                2016 campaign, he pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade, and as
                president, he accomplished that goal.</p>
            <p>The Trump administration has released <strong><a href="https://www.project2025.org/"
                        target="_blank">Project 2025</a></strong>, a detailed plan outlining the goals for the next four
                years.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Project 2025: The Effect on Abortion Access</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Threats to Medication Abortion:</strong> Mifepristone is an extremely safe and effective
                    medication
                    used commonly for medication abortion in the United States.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project 2025 outlines reinstating restrictions on mifepristone that require in-person
                            dispensing and limiting who can prescribe and receive access to it.</li>
                        <li>The plan also recommends revoking the US Food and Drug Administration's approval for
                            mifepristone, which would remove it from the market entirely.</li>
                        <li>Denying access to this drug would increase in-person abortion services which would place
                            additional strain on clinics.</li>
                        <li>Many patients will also resort to unsafe abortion methods.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/unsafe abortions.png" alt="Unsafe abortion rates">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Broader Attacks on Abortion Access:</strong> Codifying into law the Hyde and Weldon
                    Amendments,
                    which restrict the use of federal funds for abortion care.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project 2025 seeks to codify into law the Hyde and Weldon Amendments, which restrict the use
                            of federal funds for abortion care.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Denying Access to Emergency Abortion Care:</strong> The plan also calls for the Department
                    of Health and Human Services to dismantle abortion protections under the Emergency Medical Treatment
                    and Labor Act.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This would eliminate protections for people needing abortion services as a part of emergency
                            treatment</li>
                        <li>It would also end investigations into cases where patients’ rights were violated through the
                            denial of medically necessary emergency abortion care.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weaponization of Medicaid:</strong> Project 2025 calls for the Centers for Medicare &
                    Medicaid Services to encourage states to eliminate Planned Parenthood facilities from their state
                    Medicaid programs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This would have extremely negative effects on basic healthcare services across the country,
                            especially on low-income families.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contraception:</strong> The plan hopes to undermine Title X, the national publicly funded
                    family planning program, and the federal contraceptive coverage guarantee of the Affordable Care
                    Act.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This plan would make it easier for employers to exclude contraceptive coverage from their
                            employees’ health plan.</li>
                        <li>It would also prohibit crucial funding from going to entities that perform or support
                            abortion care.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;"></div>
            <p>While we don’t know for sure if these plans will be put into place during Trump’s time in office, the
                possibility alone underscores a chilling reality for reproductive rights in America, leaving many
                fearful about what the future holds. </p>
